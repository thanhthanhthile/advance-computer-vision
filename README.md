- Gradient Desent with tensorflow

# Exercise 2 - Linear Regression and Logistic Regression

What I did ?
- Generating some random data for training the Linear Regression and Logistic Regression Model
- Defining Sigmoid function, Loss function (Logistic Regression)
- Defining the hyperparameters of the model
- Trainning model
- Ploting my result
